DONE algorithm version 1.0
Matlab version (https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/61288-done-algorithm)

Laurens Bliek & Hans Verstraete, 2015

DONE minimizes a function that may suffer from noise, by approximating the function with a random Fourier expansion.

This implementation is meant to make it as clear as possible what is going on inside the algorithm. This results in a slow implementation. For faster implementations, please use the C++ dlls available at https://bitbucket.org/csi-dcsc/pydonec
